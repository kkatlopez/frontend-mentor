## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

I also added the total amount with tip and total tip as part of the bill calculations.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- jQuery

### Continued development

Here are a few things I want to add to the project:

- [x] Display total tip amount
- [x] Display amount per person before tip
- [x] Do not let users input non-float values

**All compete!**

In general, I would also like to clean up the JS code and see how I could make it more efficient.
